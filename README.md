# Welcome to Tyrsforge

**Tyrsforge** is a new beginning —  
a disciplined space where experience, curiosity, and craft converge.

With 13 years of web development behind me, this forge represents the next chapter:  
a place to refine skills, explore modern architectures, and deepen my understanding of how systems truly work.

Here I build, break, learn, and rebuild —  
always guided by patience, clarity, and a genuine desire to grow.

And while it currently holds only a few repositories,  
this is just the foundation —  
a space that will expand over time as I deepen my knowledge, experiment with new architectures,  
and shape ideas into meaningful work.

## About Me

I’m a developer who loves understanding how things work.  
Not just *using* tools, but learning the principles behind them  
so I can automate, improve, and create with intention.

I’ve been working with **React** for over five years, with **TypeScript** for more than three,  
and with **Next.js** for over two years in professional environments.  
Right now, my focus is on going deeper — exploring advanced patterns,  
frontend architectures, scalable design, and the engineering principles behind them.

I’m also expanding into:

- **Monorepos & modular design**  
- **Microfrontends**  
- **AI & automation**  
- **DevOps basics and CI/CD**  
- **Backend concepts (Node / Python)**  
- **Software craftsmanship & system design**

This repository is where all of that learning takes shape —  
a forge for experiments, guides, personal projects,  
and architectural exploration.
